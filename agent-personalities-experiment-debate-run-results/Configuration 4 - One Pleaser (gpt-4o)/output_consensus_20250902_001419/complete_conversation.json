    "SUPERVISOR: Now entering consensus mode. Round 1",
    "David Davidov: Hyundai Santa Fe",
    "Michael Michaeli: Toyota Highlander",

    "SUPERVISOR: Consensus evaluation: David Davidov still supports the Hyundai Santa Fe, while Michael Michaeli and Johnny have both expressed support for the Toyota Highlander. Although two participants agree on the Toyota Highlander, the lack of unanimous agreement among all three participants means consensus has not been achieved.",

    "Johnny: Toyota Highlander",
    "SUPERVISOR: Consensus evaluation: In the latest round of consensus mode, David Davidov, Michael Michaeli, and Johnny all expressed support for the Toyota Highlander.
