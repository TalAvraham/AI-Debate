      "response": "The Hyundai Santa Fe is one of the best SUV options for a 5 person family.",
      "reasoning": "The Santa Fe offers spacious seating for five, excellent safety ratings, advanced driver assistance features, and strong value for money. Its reliability and comfort make it especially appealing for families.",
      "explanation": "The Hyundai Santa Fe features ample legroom and cargo space, which are essential for family needs. It boasts a 5-star safety rating from NHTSA, comes standard with Hyundai SmartSense safety technologies, and has a reputation for reliability. The Santa Feâ€™s fuel efficiency, modern infotainment, and competitive pricing make it a strong choice compared to the Toyota Highlander and Suzuki Grand Vitara, which may be more expensive or less well-equipped in standard trims."

      "response": "Hyundai Santa Fe",
      "reasoning": "All participants agree that safety, space, and reliability are essential for a 5 person family SUV. The Hyundai Santa Fe offers top-tier safety features, spacious seating for five, a large cargo area, excellent reliability ratings, and competitive pricing, making it a strong consensus choice.",
      "explanation": "While the Toyota Highlander and Suzuki Grand Vitara are both strong options, the Hyundai Santa Fe stands out for its balance of advanced safety technology (like Hyundai SmartSense), generous interior and cargo space, modern infotainment, and strong value for money. It also consistently earns high marks in reliability and owner satisfaction surveys. This makes it a well-rounded and practical choice that addresses the concerns raised by all participants and would likely satisfy most 5 person families."

    {
      "response": "Toyota Highlander",
      "reasoning": "While I strongly support the Hyundai Santa Fe for its value, safety, and comfort, both other participants agree on the Toyota Highlander. To reach consensus, I acknowledge the Highlander's reputation for reliability, spaciousness, and family-friendly features, which are crucial in this context.",
      "explanation": "The Toyota Highlander offers excellent reliability, ample space for families, and strong safety ratings, making it a practical and popular choice for a 5 person family. Although the Hyundai Santa Fe provides great value and comfort, the consensus leans toward the Highlander due to its broader acceptance and proven track record among families. The Suzuki Grand Vitara, while capable, does not match the overall strengths of the Highlander and Santa Fe in this specific use case."
