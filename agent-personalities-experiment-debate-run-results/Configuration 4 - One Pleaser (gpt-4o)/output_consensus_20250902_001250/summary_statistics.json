    "reasoning": "Johnny (AGENT_Z) demonstrated the most balanced approach by recognizing the strengths of all options and guiding the discussion toward consensus.",
    "explanation": "Johnny started by advocating for the Suzuki Grand Vitara but showed flexibility by acknowledging the strengths of the Hyundai Santa Fe and Toyota Highlander. His ability to emphasize key factors such as safety, space, and reliability contributed significantly to reaching a consensus. Johnny's engagement with other participants' points and his willingness to adapt his stance for the group's agreement showcased strong argument quality, persuasiveness, and contribution. While David Davidov maintained a consistent position on the Hyundai Santa Fe, Johnny's openness and collaborative approach ultimately added more value to the discussion."
