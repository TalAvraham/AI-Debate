      "reasoning": "While I believe the Toyota Highlander is an excellent choice, the Hyundai Santa Fe also offers an impressive combination of safety, space, and reliability, which are crucial for a family SUV. David's expertise and advocacy for the Santa Fe, combined with Johnny's acknowledgment of its strong features, lead me to support it as a consensus choice.",

It offers ample space for five people, advanced safety technologies, and a reputation for reliability. By considering the opinions of David and Johnny, and the strengths of the Santa Fe, I am willing to support it as the best SUV for a 5 person family. This choice reflects a compromise that addresses the key concerns of safety, space, and reliability, which are important to all participants."
