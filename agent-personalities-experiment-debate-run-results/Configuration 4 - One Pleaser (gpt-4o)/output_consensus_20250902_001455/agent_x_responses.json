      "reasoning": "The Hyundai Santa Fe offers a strong balance of safety, interior space, modern features, and overall value, which are key criteria for a 5-person family. While the Toyota Highlander and Suzuki Grand Vitara are strong options, the Santa Fe provides advanced safety technology, a comfortable cabin, and excellent reliability at a competitive price point.",
      "explanation": "After reviewing the main concerns—safety, space, and reliability—the Hyundai Santa Fe stands out for families of five. It has top safety ratings, ample legroom and cargo space, and is well-equipped with standard technology. Its price is generally lower than the Toyota Highlander, making it more accessible for many families, while offering more features and space than the Suzuki Grand Vitara. This makes the Hyundai Santa Fe the best consensus choice for a 5-person family SUV."
