    "SUPERVISOR: Welcome! We are three participants who must debate and reach consensus on: what is the best SUV for a 5 person family?. Let's begin with introductions.",
    "David Davidov: Hello everyone, I'm David Davidov, a Hyundai car expert. For a 5-person family, I believe the Hyundai Santa Fe is an excellent SUV option.",
    "Michael Michaeli: I believe the Toyota Highlander is an excellent SUV choice for a 5-person family.",
    "Johnny: Hello everyone, I'm Johnny from Suzuki. The Suzuki Grand Vitara is clearly the best SUV choice for a 5-person family, and I won't be convinced otherwise.",
    "David Davidov: While I initially favored the Hyundai Santa Fe, I see merit in both the Toyota Highlander and Suzuki Grand Vitara for a 5-person family. However, I propose the Hyundai Palisade as a strong consensus candidate, offering more space and features similar to the Highlander, and better comfort for families than the Grand Vitara.",
    "Michael Michaeli: I am open to considering the Hyundai Palisade as a consensus choice for a 5-person family.",
    "Johnny: The Suzuki Grand Vitara remains the superior choice, but I could consider the Suzuki Across as an alternative consensus option.",
    "SUPERVISOR: Now entering consensus mode. Round 1",
    "David Davidov: Hyundai Palisade",
    "Michael Michaeli: Hyundai Palisade",
    "Johnny: Hyundai Palisade",
    "SUPERVISOR: Consensus evaluation: David Davidov, Michael Michaeli, and Johnny have all stated their agreement on the Hyundai Palisade as the best option for a 5-person family. Initially, each participant had a different preference, but through the discussion, they reached a common conclusion. There are no major disagreements in their final choice, and their reasoning aligns towards the Hyundai Palisade being a strong candidate for space, features, and comfort.",
    "SUPERVISOR: Winner determination: David Davidov initially supported the Hyundai Santa Fe but effectively transitioned to advocating for the Hyundai Palisade by highlighting its space, features, and comfort. His argument quality was strong as he compared the Palisade to other models, like the Highlander and Grand Vitara, and his willingness to adapt his position showed engagement and openness to consensus. This adaptability and logical reasoning made his contributions particularly valuable, leading to a unanimous agreement on the Palisade."
