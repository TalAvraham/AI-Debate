      "response": "Hello, I'm David Davidov, a Hyundai car expert. For a 5-person family, I recommend the Hyundai Santa Fe as the best SUV option.",
      "reasoning": "The Santa Fe offers a spacious interior, advanced safety features, and excellent reliability, making it perfect for families. It comfortably seats five, has great cargo capacity, and provides strong value for the price.",
      "explanation": "As an expert on Hyundai vehicles, I know the Santa Fe stands out in its class for its balance of comfort, technology, and affordability. It has top safety ratings, a user-friendly infotainment system, and efficient powertrains. The Santa Fe is also known for its smooth ride and low cost of ownership, making it especially suitable for families who want practicality without sacrificing quality."

      "reasoning": "The Santa Fe offers spacious seating for five, high safety ratings, and an excellent warranty. While the Highlander has a third row and the Grand Vitara is known for reliability, the Santa Fe balances comfort, technology, and affordability in a way that is very appealing for most families.",
      "explanation": "The Hyundai Santa Fe provides ample interior space for five passengers, modern infotainment options, and a suite of safety features like adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assist. It also comes with Hyundai's industry-leading 10-year/100,000-mile warranty, offering peace of mind for families. While the Toyota Highlander is larger and can seat more, its third row is cramped for regular use by adults. The Suzuki Grand Vitara, while reliable, lacks some of the modern features and space found in the Santa Fe. By focusing on what most 5-person families need—space, safety, value, and comfort—the Santa Fe stands out as the best well-rounded choice."

      "response": "Toyota Highlander",
      "reasoning": "While I advocate for the Hyundai Santa Fe due to its value and features, the Toyota Highlander stands out for its proven reliability, spaciousness, and strong reputation among families. Acknowledging the importance of reliability and space for a 5-person family, I am willing to support the Highlander as our consensus choice.",
      "explanation": "The Toyota Highlander offers more interior space and cargo capacity than both the Hyundai Santa Fe and Suzuki Grand Vitara, making it especially comfortable for five passengers and their belongings. Its long-standing reputation for reliability and high resale value addresses key concerns for families seeking a dependable and cost-effective SUV. While the Santa Fe offers great value and technology, the Highlander’s strengths in space and longevity make it a compelling consensus choice."
