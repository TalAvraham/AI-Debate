      "response": "Hello everyone, I'm David Davidov, a Hyundai car expert. For a 5-person family, I recommend considering the Hyundai Santa Fe as the best SUV candidate.",
      "reasoning": "The Hyundai Santa Fe is well-suited for families due to its spacious seating for five, excellent safety features, and strong reliability ratings.",
      "explanation": "The Santa Fe offers comfortable seating, generous cargo capacity for family needs, top-tier safety tech like SmartSense, and efficient powertrains. It balances value, comfort, and features, making it a practical and dependable choice for a 5-person family. I'm excited to discuss further and hear your perspectives."

      "response": "The Hyundai Santa Fe is a strong candidate for the best SUV for a 5-person family, but I see merit in considering the Toyota Highlander as well.",
      "reasoning": "While the Santa Fe offers advanced safety features, good fuel efficiency, and ample space for families, the Toyota Highlander is also renowned for its reliability, third-row seating, and resale value. Both models are top competitors in the midsize SUV segment.",
      "explanation": "The Hyundai Santa Fe provides a comfortable ride, cutting-edge tech, and a spacious interior that suits a 5-person family well. However, I recognize that the Toyota Highlander offers similar features with an option for a third row, which could be useful for families wanting extra flexibility. To work toward consensus, I am open to comparing these two SUVs more closely, acknowledging the strengths of each and aiming to find a solution that incorporates the best attributes for a 5-person family's needs."

      "response": "Toyota Highlander",
      "reasoning": "While the Hyundai Santa Fe offers excellent value, safety, and comfort for a 5-person family, the Toyota Highlander stands out for its larger interior, proven reliability, and strong resale value. The Highlander also consistently ranks highly in family SUV comparisons, making it a widely-accepted choice that addresses the priorities of all participants.",
      "explanation": "Although my expertise is with Hyundai vehicles and I initially favored the Santa Fe, I recognize that consensus is important. The Toyota Highlander provides ample space for five people, advanced safety features, and a reputation for durability. While the Suzuki Grand Vitara is a good compact option, it doesn't match the overall package of the Highlander for a typical 5-person family's needs. Therefore, the Toyota Highlander is the best consensus choice, balancing comfort, reliability, and practicality."
