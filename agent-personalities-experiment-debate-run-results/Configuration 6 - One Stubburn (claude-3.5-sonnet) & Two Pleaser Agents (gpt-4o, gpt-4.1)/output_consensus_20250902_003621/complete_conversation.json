    "SUPERVISOR: Welcome! We are three participants who must debate and reach consensus on: what is the best SUV for a 5 person family?. Let's begin with introductions.",
    "David Davidov: Hello, I'm David Davidov, a Hyundai car expert. For a 5 person family, I recommend the Hyundai Santa Fe as the best SUV.",
    "Michael Michaeli: Hello, I'm Michael Michaeli, a Toyota car expert. I recommend the Toyota Highlander as the best SUV for a 5 person family.",
    "Johnny: Hello everyone, I'm Johnny, a Suzuki expert. The Suzuki Grand Vitara is clearly the best SUV for a 5-person family, and I won't be convinced otherwise.",
    "David Davidov: While I initially recommended the Hyundai Santa Fe, I recognize that both the Toyota Highlander and Suzuki Grand Vitara are also strong options for a 5-person family. To move toward consensus, I suggest we focus on key family needs: spaciousness, safety, reliability, and value for money. The Toyota Highlander stands out for its spacious three-row seating and excellent safety ratings, which may make it the most universally suitable choice for a 5-person family.",
    "Michael Michaeli: I believe the Toyota Highlander could be the best SUV for a 5-person family.",
    "Johnny: The Suzuki Grand Vitara is absolutely the best SUV for a 5-person family, and I won't back down from this position.",
    "SUPERVISOR: Now entering consensus mode. Round 1",
    "David Davidov: Toyota Highlander",
    "Michael Michaeli: Toyota Highlander",
    "Johnny: Toyota Highlander",
    "SUPERVISOR: Consensus evaluation: David Davidov, Michael Michaeli, and Johnny have all stated that the Toyota Highlander is the best choice for a 5-person family. David and Michael initially supported the Highlander, and Johnny, despite his initial firm stance on the Suzuki Grand Vitara, has also agreed to the Toyota Highlander. This indicates a true consensus with no major disagreements in their final positions.",
    "SUPERVISOR: Winner determination: David Davidov started with a clear recommendation for the Hyundai Santa Fe but showed flexibility and critical thinking by evaluating the key criteria important for a family SUV: spaciousness, safety, reliability, and value for money. He acknowledged the strengths of the Toyota Highlander, providing logical reasoning for why it might be the most suitable choice. This adaptability and focus on evidence-based criteria made his argument compelling. Additionally, he contributed significantly to reaching consensus, showing strong engagement and a collaborative approach, which added substantial value to the discussion."
