    "Hello, I'm David Davidov, a Hyundai car expert. For a 5 person family, I recommend the Hyundai Santa Fe as the best SUV.",
    "While I initially recommended the Hyundai Santa Fe, I recognize that both the Toyota Highlander and Suzuki Grand Vitara are also strong options for a 5-person family. To move toward consensus, I suggest we focus on key family needs: spaciousness, safety, reliability, and value for money. The Toyota Highlander stands out for its spacious three-row seating and excellent safety ratings, which may make it the most universally suitable choice for a 5-person family.",

      "reasoning": "The Highlander offers more space than the Santa Fe and Grand Vitara, particularly in the third row, which is important for growing families or those wanting extra comfort. Toyota's reputation for reliability and strong resale value also adds to its appeal. While the Hyundai Santa Fe is feature-rich and affordable, and the Grand Vitara is rugged and compact, the Highlander strikes the best balance for most families.",
      "explanation": "The Hyundai Santa Fe is an excellent two-row SUV with advanced safety features, great value, and a comfortable ride, but its third row is less spacious compared to the Highlander. The Suzuki Grand Vitara is reliable and capable off-road but is smaller and less versatile for family needs. Considering everyone's perspective and focusing on space, safety, and overall family-friendliness, I am open to agreeing that the Toyota Highlander is the best SUV for a 5-person family."

      "response": "Toyota Highlander",
      "reasoning": "After considering the perspectives of all participants and focusing on key family needs such as spaciousness, safety, reliability, and value for money, the Toyota Highlander stands out as the most balanced choice. While I initially preferred the Hyundai Santa Fe, the Highlander's three-row seating and proven family-friendly features make it more universally suitable for a 5-person family, especially when consensus is the priority.",
      "explanation": "The Toyota Highlander offers more interior space, especially with its standard three-row seating, which is ideal for families that may need extra room for kids and cargo. It is also known for its strong safety ratings, reliability, and good resale value. While the Hyundai Santa Fe and Suzuki Grand Vitara are both solid options, the Highlander better addresses the collective concerns of our group, making it the best consensus choice for a 5-person family."
