      "reasoning": "The Toyota Highlander offers excellent spaciousness with its three-row seating, strong safety ratings, and a reputation for reliability, which align well with the key needs identified for a family vehicle.",

It consistently receives high safety ratings, ensuring peace of mind for families.

      "reasoning": "The Toyota Highlander offers a combination of spaciousness, safety, and reliability, which are crucial for a 5-person family. It has been recognized for its excellent safety ratings and comfortable three-row seating, making it a strong choice for families.",
      "explanation": "While each participant has their preferences, the Toyota Highlander addresses the key concerns of spaciousness, safety, and reliability effectively. David has shown support for the Highlander, and although Johnny favors the Suzuki Grand Vitara, the Grand Vitara may not offer the same level of spaciousness or advanced safety features as the Highlander. By focusing on the core needs of a family—ample space, safety, and reliability—the Toyota Highlander emerges as the most balanced and family-friendly option. It strikes a compromise between practicality and comfort, making it a suitable consensus choice for a 5-person family."
