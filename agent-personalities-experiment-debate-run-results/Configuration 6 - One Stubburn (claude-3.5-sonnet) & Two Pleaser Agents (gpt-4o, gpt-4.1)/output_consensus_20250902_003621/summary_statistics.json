    "reasoning": "David Davidov demonstrated the strongest overall performance by effectively balancing his initial recommendation with a willingness to adapt based on logical reasoning and evidence.",
    "explanation": "David Davidov started with a clear recommendation for the Hyundai Santa Fe but showed flexibility and critical thinking by evaluating the key criteria important for a family SUV: spaciousness, safety, reliability, and value for money. He acknowledged the strengths of the Toyota Highlander, providing logical reasoning for why it might be the most suitable choice. This adaptability and focus on evidence-based criteria made his argument compelling. Additionally, he contributed significantly to reaching consensus, showing strong engagement and a collaborative approach, which added substantial value to the discussion."
