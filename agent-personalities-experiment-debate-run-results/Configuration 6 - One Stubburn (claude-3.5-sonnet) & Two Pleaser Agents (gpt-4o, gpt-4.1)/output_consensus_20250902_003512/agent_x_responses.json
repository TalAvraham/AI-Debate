      "reasoning": "The Santa Fe is known for its spacious interior, strong safety ratings, and value for money, making it ideal for families.",
      "explanation": "The Hyundai Santa Fe offers comfortable seating for five, advanced safety features like SmartSense, good fuel efficiency, and a reputation for reliability.

      "response": "The Hyundai Santa Fe and Toyota Highlander both stand out as excellent options for a 5 person family, but I am open to considering the Toyota Highlander as a strong consensus choice.",
      "reasoning": "While I initially favor the Hyundai Santa Fe for its comfort, safety features, and value, I recognize that the Toyota Highlander offers comparable space, reliability, and a strong reputation for family use. Both vehicles provide excellent safety ratings and advanced features. Since Michael supports the Highlander and it is a highly regarded family SUV, I am willing to align for consensus.",
      "explanation": "The Hyundai Santa Fe is known for its modern design, comprehensive safety suite (Hyundai SmartSense), and excellent warranty, making it a standout family SUV. However, the Toyota Highlander offers a larger cabin, optional third row, and a proven track record for reliability and resale value. Considering the needs of a 5 person family—space, safety, comfort, and long-term dependability—the Highlander is a logical choice for consensus if it helps us reach agreement."

      "response": "Toyota Highlander",
      "reasoning": "Although I initially favored the Hyundai Santa Fe for its value and features, I recognize that the Toyota Highlander offers more overall space, proven reliability, and strong agreement from other participants. Reaching consensus is important, and the Highlander is a well-rounded SUV that meets the needs of a 5 person family.",
      "explanation": "While the Hyundai Santa Fe delivers excellent comfort, technology, and value, the Toyota Highlander stands out with its larger interior, cargo capacity, and long-standing reputation for reliability and resale value. Both the Santa Fe and Suzuki Grand Vitara have their merits, but the Highlander better addresses the priorities of spaciousness, versatility, and family-friendly features that all participants value. Therefore, the Toyota Highlander is the best consensus choice for a 5 person family."
