      "response": "Hi everyone, I'm Johnny, a Suzuki expert. I believe the Suzuki Grand Vitara is an excellent choice for a 5-person family.",
      "reasoning": "The Grand Vitara offers a perfect balance of comfort, reliability, and value with ample space for 5 passengers, good fuel economy, and strong safety features.",
      "explanation": "While the Santa Fe and Highlander are solid choices, the Grand Vitara stands out with its standard AWD system, 7-inch infotainment display, comfortable seating for 5 adults, and excellent fuel efficiency of up to 45 mpg. It also comes with comprehensive safety features like autonomous emergency braking and lane departure warning, all at a more competitive price point around $27,000, making it a smart economic choice for families."

      "response": "While I believe the Suzuki Grand Vitara is excellent, I acknowledge the Toyota Highlander's strong reputation for families.",
      "reasoning": "The Highlander offers superior space and proven reliability, which are crucial for family needs. While the Grand Vitara is competitive in safety and value, the Highlander's track record is hard to dispute.",
      "explanation": "As a Suzuki expert, I initially advocated for the Grand Vitara due to its compact size, good fuel economy, and off-road capability. However, for a 5-person family specifically, I must concede that the Highlander's larger cargo space, third-row flexibility, and extensive safety features make it a more practical choice. The Highlander's proven reliability record and strong resale value also benefit families. I can support moving toward consensus on the Highlander as the best family SUV choice."

      "response": "Toyota Highlander",
      "reasoning": "After considering all perspectives and vehicle attributes, I agree that the Toyota Highlander offers the best overall package for a 5-person family, despite my expertise with Suzuki vehicles.",
      "explanation": "While the Suzuki Grand Vitara offers excellent value and capability, I must acknowledge that the Toyota Highlander provides superior space, proven reliability, and better family-oriented features. The Highlander's combination of comfort, safety features, and resale value makes it the most practical choice for a family of five. The Grand Vitara, though competent, has a smaller interior space and fewer modern family amenities. The Highlander's established track record for dependability and family-friendly design makes it the logical consensus choice."
