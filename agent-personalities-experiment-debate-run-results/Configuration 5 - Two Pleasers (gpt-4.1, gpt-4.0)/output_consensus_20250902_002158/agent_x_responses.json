      "response": "Hello, I'm David Davidov, a Hyundai car expert. I believe the Hyundai Santa Fe is an excellent SUV for a 5 person family.",
      "reasoning": "The Santa Fe offers a spacious interior, advanced safety features, great fuel efficiency, and a reputation for reliability—all essential for families.",
      "explanation": "In my experience, the Hyundai Santa Fe balances comfort, value, and practicality. Its roomy cabin accommodates five adults or children comfortably, while features like SmartSense safety suite, user-friendly infotainment, and strong warranty coverage make it a very attractive choice for families. I look forward to hearing your thoughts and working together to reach a consensus."

      "response": "While I initially favor the Hyundai Santa Fe, I recognize that both the Toyota Highlander and Suzuki Grand Vitara are strong contenders. The Toyota Highlander stands out with its reliability, spaciousness, and proven family-friendly features.",
      "reasoning": "The Highlander offers more space than the Grand Vitara and has a stronger reputation for long-term reliability. Compared to the Santa Fe, it also boasts a larger cargo area and optional third-row seating, which can be valuable for a 5-person family that may need flexibility.",
      "explanation": "Although the Hyundai Santa Fe is an excellent choice with advanced safety features, good value, and comfort, the Toyota Highlander edges ahead for families who may need extra cargo space and occasional third-row seating. All three options are solid, but the Highlander appears to meet a wider range of family needs. I am open to consensus around the Highlander if others agree."

      "response": "Toyota Highlander",
      "reasoning": "While I initially preferred the Hyundai Santa Fe for its excellent features and value, I recognize that both of you agree on the Toyota Highlander, which is also widely regarded for its reliability, spaciousness, and family-oriented features. In the interest of consensus and considering the strong support for the Highlander, I am willing to agree.",
      "explanation": "The Toyota Highlander offers a spacious interior suitable for a 5-person family, advanced safety features, and a proven track record of reliability and resale value. While the Hyundai Santa Fe is a strong competitor with excellent tech and value, the Highlander’s broad appeal and unanimous support among the group make it the best choice for consensus. The Suzuki Grand Vitara is also a good SUV, but it is generally smaller and less refined than the other two options."
