      "response": "Toyota Highlander",
      "reasoning": "While my expertise is with Hyundai vehicles and the Santa Fe is a strong contender, both Michael and Johnny recognize the Highlander's strengths and agree it offers a great combination of space, reliability, and family-friendly features. To reach consensus, I am willing to support the Highlander as the best overall choice for a 5 person family.",
      "explanation": "The Toyota Highlander stands out for its spacious interior, proven reliability, advanced safety features, and strong resale value. While the Hyundai Santa Fe offers great value, comfort, and technology, and the Suzuki Grand Vitara provides affordability and ruggedness, the Highlander best meets the needs of a 5 person family by combining comfort, capacity, and long-term dependability. This consensus reflects a balanced consideration of all perspectives."
