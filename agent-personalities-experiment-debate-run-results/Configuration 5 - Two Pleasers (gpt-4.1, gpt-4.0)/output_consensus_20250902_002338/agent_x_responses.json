      "reasoning": "The Hyundai Santa Fe is spacious, safe, reliable, and offers great value for families. It seats five comfortably, comes with advanced safety features, and has a strong reputation for reliability and fuel efficiency.",
      "explanation": "The Santa Fe provides ample cargo space and legroom for all passengers, making it ideal for families.

      "response": "While I initially recommended the Hyundai Santa Fe, I see strong arguments for the Toyota Highlander due to its long-standing reputation for reliability and spaciousness. For consensus, I am open to supporting the Toyota Highlander as the best SUV for a 5 person family.",
      "reasoning": "The Toyota Highlander offers more third-row space and cargo capacity compared to the Santa Fe, and is widely praised for its dependability, which is critical for families. While the Santa Fe excels in value and technology, the Highlander might better meet the needs of a larger family.",
      "explanation": "Both the Hyundai Santa Fe and Toyota Highlander are great options, but consensus is important. The Highlanderâ€™s larger interior, proven reliability, and strong resale value give it an edge for a 5 person family. I acknowledge these benefits and am willing to align with the group if the Highlander is preferred."

      "reasoning": "Although I am a Hyundai expert and initially recommended the Hyundai Santa Fe, both Michael and Johnny have agreed that the Toyota Highlander is the best choice. The consensus among the group is clear, and I support this decision to reach agreement.",
      "explanation": "The Toyota Highlander is well-known for its reliability, spacious interior, advanced safety features, and strong resale value, making it an excellent choice for a 5 person family. While the Hyundai Santa Fe offers great value and comfort, and the Suzuki Grand Vitara is a solid contender, the group has found the Highlander to be the most balanced option. By supporting this consensus, we address the key concerns of reliability, comfort, and overall satisfaction for a 5 person family."
