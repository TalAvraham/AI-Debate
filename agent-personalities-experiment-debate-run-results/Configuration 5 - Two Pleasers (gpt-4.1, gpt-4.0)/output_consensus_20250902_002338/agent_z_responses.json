      "response": "Hi everyone, I'm Johnny, a Suzuki expert. For a 5-person family, I strongly recommend considering the Suzuki Grand Vitara as an excellent SUV choice.",
      "reasoning": "The Grand Vitara offers the perfect balance of size, reliability, fuel efficiency, and value for a family of five. It provides comfortable seating for 5 adults, good cargo space, and comes with advanced safety features.",
      "explanation": "While the Santa Fe and Highlander are solid choices, the Grand Vitara stands out with its AllGrip all-wheel-drive system, excellent fuel economy averaging 45 MPG, and a comprehensive safety package including autonomous emergency braking and lane departure warning. It's also more affordable than both competitors while offering similar interior space and comfort features. The hybrid powertrain provides both performance and efficiency that families need."

      "response": "While I still believe the Suzuki Grand Vitara is excellent, I can agree that the Toyota Highlander is the best overall SUV choice for a 5-person family.",
      "reasoning": "The Highlander offers superior reliability, space, and safety features compared to the Grand Vitara. Its track record and market position make it a more practical choice for most families.",
      "explanation": "Although the Grand Vitara offers good value and capable off-road performance, I must acknowledge that the Highlander's combination of spacious interior, proven reliability, advanced safety features, and strong resale value makes it the optimal choice for a family of five. The Highlander's third-row seating option, better fuel economy, and more modern amenities give it clear advantages over both the Grand Vitara and Santa Fe. I support reaching consensus on the Toyota Highlander as the best family SUV choice."

      "reasoning": "After considering all perspectives and vehicle attributes, I agree that the Toyota Highlander offers the best overall package for a 5-person family, surpassing even the Suzuki Grand Vitara in key areas.",
      "explanation": "While the Suzuki Grand Vitara offers excellent value and capable off-road performance, I must acknowledge that the Toyota Highlander provides superior interior space, better fuel efficiency, higher safety ratings, and proven long-term reliability that better serves a family of five. The Highlander's combination of comfortable seating, ample cargo space, advanced safety features, and strong resale value makes it the most practical and sensible choice. The Grand Vitara remains a solid option for more adventurous families, but for overall family use, I agree the Highlander is the best choice."
