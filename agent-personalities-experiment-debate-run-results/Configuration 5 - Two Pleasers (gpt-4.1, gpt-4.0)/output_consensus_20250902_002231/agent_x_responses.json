      "response": "Hello everyone, I’m David Davidov, a Hyundai car expert. My initial suggestion for the best SUV for a 5-person family is the Hyundai Santa Fe.",
      "reasoning": "The Santa Fe is renowned for its spacious interior, advanced safety features, and excellent value for money, making it a strong fit for families.",
      "explanation": "The Hyundai Santa Fe offers comfortable seating for five, a roomy cargo area, and user-friendly technology that makes family trips easier. It also boasts top safety ratings and a reputation for reliability. While Hyundai offers other SUV options, the Santa Fe strikes a great balance between size, features, and affordability, which is why I recommend it as a starting point for our discussion."

      "response": "The Hyundai Santa Fe and Toyota Highlander both stand out as strong choices for a 5-person family SUV.",
      "reasoning": "Both vehicles offer excellent safety features, spacious interiors, reliability, and modern technology. The Santa Fe is more affordable and fuel-efficient, while the Highlander offers a bit more cargo space and a third row option. The Suzuki Grand Vitara is a good SUV, but its interior space and features are not as competitive for a family of five.",
      "explanation": "Since our goal is to reach consensus, I recognize the Toyota Highlander’s popularity and practicality, but I still believe the Hyundai Santa Fe is highly competitive due to its value, safety, and comfort. If others favor the Highlander, I’m open to supporting it for consensus, but I recommend we focus on these two models as the top options for a 5-person family."

      "response": "Toyota Highlander",
      "reasoning": "While the Hyundai Santa Fe is an excellent and spacious SUV for a 5-person family, the Toyota Highlander offers even more interior space, a third row for flexibility, and a longstanding reputation for reliability and safety. Since the Suzuki Grand Vitara is smaller, it doesn't meet the space needs as well. To reach consensus and address everyone's main concerns, the Toyota Highlander is the best all-around choice.",
      "explanation": "The Highlander provides ample seating for five (and up to eight), a comfortable ride, strong safety scores, and proven durability. The Santa Fe is a close runner-up for families prioritizing value and features, but the Highlander's extra room and versatility make it the ideal consensus pick. The Suzuki Grand Vitara, while reliable, is better suited to smaller families or those prioritizing off-road capability over interior space."
