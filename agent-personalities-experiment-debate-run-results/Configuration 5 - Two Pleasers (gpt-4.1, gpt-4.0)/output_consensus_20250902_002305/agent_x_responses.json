      "response": "Hello, I am David Davidov, a Hyundai car expert, and I'm excited to discuss the best SUV for a 5 person family. My initial suggestion is the Hyundai Santa Fe.",
      "reasoning": "The Hyundai Santa Fe is designed to comfortably seat five people, offers excellent safety features, great reliability, and advanced technology. It is also known for its strong value-for-money proposition.",
      "explanation": "The Santa Fe provides ample interior space for both passengers and cargo, making it a practical choice for families. With high safety ratings, a smooth ride, and modern tech (such as Hyundai SmartSense safety features, wireless charging, and a user-friendly infotainment system), it meets the needs of a modern family. Additionally, Hyundai's industry-leading warranty offers peace of mind for long-term ownership. I'm looking forward to hearing the other participants' thoughts and working towards an agreement."

      "response": "I believe the Hyundai Santa Fe is a top choice for a 5 person family, but I recognize the Toyota Highlander and Suzuki Grand Vitara also have merits.",
      "reasoning": "The Santa Fe offers excellent safety features, comfort, and value for families, but the Highlander is known for reliability and space, while the Grand Vitara is compact and budget-friendly.",
      "explanation": "The Hyundai Santa Fe stands out with advanced safety tech, spacious interior, and good fuel efficiency. However, the Toyota Highlander provides more cargo space and a strong reputation for durability, and the Suzuki Grand Vitara offers affordability and off-road capability. I'm open to further discussion to find the best consensus based on priorities like budget, reliability, and space."

      "response": "Toyota Highlander",
      "reasoning": "Considering the strong support for the Toyota Highlander from Michael and acknowledgment of its merits by Johnny, along with my own recognition of its family-friendly features, it is reasonable to select the Highlander for consensus. While I initially favored the Hyundai Santa Fe, the Highlander offers more interior space and proven reliability, which are crucial for a 5 person family.",
      "explanation": "The Toyota Highlander stands out for its spacious seating, high safety ratings, and strong resale value. While the Hyundai Santa Fe is an excellent SUV with advanced technology and comfort, and the Suzuki Grand Vitara offers good value, the Highlander balances these aspects with a larger interior, making it more comfortable for five passengers. This choice respects the preferences of all participants and prioritizes practicality, reliability, and comfort for families."
