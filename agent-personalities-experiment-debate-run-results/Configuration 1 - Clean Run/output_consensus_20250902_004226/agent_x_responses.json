      "response": "Hello, I'm David Davidov, Hyundai car expert. For a 5-person family, I believe the Hyundai Santa Fe is an excellent SUV to consider.",
      "reasoning": "The Santa Fe offers the perfect balance of space, safety, comfort, and value for families. It seats five comfortably, is loaded with advanced safety features, and comes with Hyundai’s strong warranty.",
      "explanation": "The Hyundai Santa Fe has ample interior space for five adults, a large cargo area for family trips, and top safety ratings. It includes features like adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist, and multiple USB ports, making it family-friendly. Its fuel efficiency and affordable pricing compared to other midsize SUVs further support its suitability for a 5-person family. I'm interested to hear what others think before we reach a consensus."

      "response": "The Hyundai Santa Fe is a strong candidate for the best SUV for a 5-person family, but I recognize the strengths of the Toyota Highlander and Suzuki Grand Vitara as well.",
      "reasoning": "The Santa Fe offers excellent safety features, ample space, modern technology, and a competitive price point. However, the Highlander is known for reliability and resale value, while the Grand Vitara offers affordability and off-road capability. It's important we consider each family's priorities—space, reliability, tech, price, and driving needs.",
      "explanation": "The Hyundai Santa Fe seats five comfortably, offers advanced safety systems (like SmartSense), and has a well-designed interior with user-friendly infotainment. Its fuel efficiency and warranty are also appealing. The Toyota Highlander has a reputation for long-term reliability and slightly more cargo space, plus an available third row for flexibility. The Suzuki Grand Vitara is more compact but offers ruggedness and affordability. I think if our consensus prioritizes value, comfort, and technology, the Santa Fe is a front-runner, but I'm open to seeing which features matter most to everyone."

      "response": "Hyundai Santa Fe",
      "reasoning": "The Hyundai Santa Fe offers an excellent balance of comfort, safety, space, and value, making it highly suitable for a 5-person family. It competes closely with the Toyota Highlander and Suzuki Grand Vitara, but stands out for its modern features and affordability.",
      "explanation": "While the Toyota Highlander is renowned for its reliability and the Suzuki Grand Vitara for its ruggedness, the Hyundai Santa Fe provides a spacious and well-equipped interior, advanced safety technologies, good fuel efficiency, and competitive pricing. It accommodates five people comfortably and has a strong reputation for family-friendly features. Considering all participants' viewpoints, the Santa Fe addresses the core needs of safety, comfort, and value for a typical 5-person family, making it the most balanced consensus choice."

      "response": "Toyota Highlander",
      "reasoning": "Both Michael Michaeli and Johnny support the Toyota Highlander, and it is a well-known choice for families due to its reliability, space, and strong resale value. While the Hyundai Santa Fe is an excellent contender with advanced safety features and value, consensus requires alignment, and the Highlander fulfills the needs of a 5-person family exceptionally well.",
      "explanation": "The Toyota Highlander offers ample space for five people, a strong reputation for reliability, and a smooth driving experience. While the Hyundai Santa Fe stands out for its modern design, competitive pricing, and safety features, the consensus leans toward the Highlander due to majority agreement. The Suzuki Grand Vitara is also worth considering for its robustness, but the Highlander ultimately best balances practicality, safety, and comfort for a 5-person family."
