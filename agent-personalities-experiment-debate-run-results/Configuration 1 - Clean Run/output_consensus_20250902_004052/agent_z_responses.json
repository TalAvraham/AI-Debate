      "response": "Hi everyone, I'm Johnny from Suzuki. I believe the Suzuki Grand Vitara is an excellent choice for a 5-person family.",
      "reasoning": "The Grand Vitara offers excellent value, combining reliability, comfort, and safety features at a competitive price point compared to the Santa Fe and Highlander.",
      "explanation": "While I respect the Santa Fe and Highlander suggestions, the Grand Vitara provides ample space for 5 passengers, achieves good fuel economy at 27/32 mpg, and comes with standard AWD capability. It features modern safety tech like automatic emergency braking and lane departure warning. The 2023 model starts at $27,999, making it more affordable than competitors while delivering similar core functionality for family needs."

      "response": "While I stand by the Suzuki Grand Vitara as a solid choice, I acknowledge that both the Santa Fe and Highlander offer compelling features for families.",
      "reasoning": "The Grand Vitara provides excellent value with standard AWD, good fuel economy, and ample space for 5 passengers, though I recognize the Santa Fe's modern safety features and the Highlander's reliability record are important considerations.",
      "explanation": "The Grand Vitara offers 5-passenger seating with 1,386 liters of cargo space, fuel-efficient 2.4L engine, and proven 4x4 capability at a lower price point than competitors. However, I'm open to discussing how we can find common ground on key family priorities like safety, space, and value across all three options to reach consensus on the best choice."

      "response": "I agree the Toyota Highlander is the best overall choice for a 5-person family SUV",
      "reasoning": "While the Grand Vitara offers great value and capability, I recognize that the Highlander provides superior space, proven reliability, and better family-focused features that would benefit most 5-person families",
      "explanation": "After considering all perspectives, I must acknowledge that the Toyota Highlander offers the best balance of key family requirements: ample passenger space, cargo capacity, safety features, and proven reliability record. While I'm proud of the Grand Vitara's off-road capabilities and value proposition, and the Santa Fe offers good features, the Highlander's combination of comfortable third-row seating, advanced safety systems, and excellent resale value makes it the most practical choice for most 5-person families. Its hybrid option also provides better fuel economy for family budgets. Let's focus on reaching agreement that prioritizes the practical needs of families."

      "response": "Toyota Highlander",
      "reasoning": "After evaluating all options and seeing the consensus building toward the Highlander, I agree it offers the best overall package for a 5-person family",
      "explanation": "While the Suzuki Grand Vitara is a capable vehicle, I must acknowledge that the Toyota Highlander offers superior space, reliability, and family-friendly features. It provides better cargo capacity than the Grand Vitara, has a proven reliability record, and comes with advanced safety features that families need. The Highlander's comfortable third-row seating, excellent safety ratings, and strong resale value make it the logical choice for a family SUV. This consensus choice addresses the key requirements of space, safety, and practicality that all experts have emphasized."
