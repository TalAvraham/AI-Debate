      "response": "The Toyota Highlander is the best SUV for a 5 person family.",
      "reasoning": "The Toyota Highlander provides an excellent balance of space, reliability, and safety features, making it ideal for a 5 person family. It offers a spacious interior with three rows of seating, advanced safety technology, and a strong reputation for durability. While the Hyundai Santa Fe and Suzuki Grand Vitara have their advantages, the Highlander's overall package is more comprehensive for family needs.",
      "explanation": "The Toyota Highlander stands out as a top choice due to its spacious seating for up to eight people, which is more than sufficient for a family of five. It is equipped with Toyota's Safety Sense suite, which includes features like pre-collision systems and adaptive cruise control. Additionally, the Highlander is known for its reliability and high resale value, which are important factors for family investments. While the Hyundai Santa Fe offers a comfortable ride and the Suzuki Grand Vitara provides good off-road capability, the Highlander provides a more well-rounded offering for a family SUV, accommodating both city and highway driving seamlessly. Therefore, it addresses the primary concerns of space, safety, and reliability effectively."
