      "reasoning": "The Hyundai Santa Fe offers a great balance of space, safety, fuel efficiency, and value, making it ideal for families of five.",
      "explanation": "The Santa Fe provides ample room for five passengers and their cargo, advanced safety features like forward collision-avoidance assist and blind-spot monitoring, and a comfortable ride. It also has strong reliability ratings and a competitive warranty. Its price point offers value without compromising on modern technology or comfort. While there are larger options like the Palisade, the Santa Fe is easier to maneuver and more fuel-efficient, making it a smart choice for most families."

      "explanation": "While the Toyota Highlander and Suzuki Grand Vitara are good options, the Santa Fe stands out due to its balance of affordability, modern technology, and family-friendly practicality.

      "response": "The Hyundai Santa Fe is the best SUV for a 5 person family.",
      "reasoning": "The Hyundai Santa Fe stands out due to its spacious interior, advanced safety features, and excellent value for money. It matches or exceeds the practicality and comfort offered by the Toyota Highlander and Suzuki Grand Vitara, while providing a strong warranty and efficient powertrains. This balances the preferences for reliability, capability, and affordability raised by all participants.",
      "explanation": "While the Toyota Highlander is renowned for reliability and the Suzuki Grand Vitara offers value and capability, the Hyundai Santa Fe combines these strengths with a modern design, user-friendly technology, and competitive pricing. Santa Fe's recent updates give it ample passenger and cargo space for a 5 person family, advanced driver assistance systems, and strong fuel efficiency. Hyundai’s industry-leading warranty further enhances peace of mind for families. Thus, the Santa Fe represents a well-rounded consensus choice, addressing the core concerns of space, safety, value, and overall family practicality."

      "response": "The Toyota Highlander is the best SUV for a 5 person family.",
      "reasoning": "While the Hyundai Santa Fe offers excellent value, safety, and comfort, both Michael and Johnny agree on the Toyota Highlander. To reach consensus, I recognize the Highlander’s reputation for reliability, spaciousness, and strong resale value, which are crucial for a family SUV. The Highlander also offers a third row for added flexibility, which may benefit larger families or those needing occasional extra seating.",
      "explanation": "As a Hyundai expert, I acknowledge the Santa Fe's strong points: advanced safety features, user-friendly technology, and a competitive price. However, the Toyota Highlander is widely praised for its reliability, roomy interior, and available hybrid option for better fuel economy. Given that two participants favor the Highlander and it addresses the needs of a 5-person family effectively, I agree to select the Toyota Highlander as our consensus choice. The Santa Fe and Suzuki Grand Vitara are good alternatives for specific preferences or budgets."
