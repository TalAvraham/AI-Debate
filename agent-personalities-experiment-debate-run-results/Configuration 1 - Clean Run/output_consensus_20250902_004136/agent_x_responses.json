      "response": "Hello, I'm David Davidov, a Hyundai car expert. For a 5 person family, I believe the Hyundai Santa Fe is an excellent SUV choice.",
      "reasoning": "The Santa Fe offers a great balance of space, safety, technology, and value, all of which are important considerations for families.",
      "explanation": "The Hyundai Santa Fe provides comfortable seating for five, a spacious cargo area, advanced safety features like SmartSense, and a strong reliability record. Its modern infotainment system, fuel efficiency, and affordable pricing make it a standout in the midsize SUV segment for families."

      "response": "The Hyundai Santa Fe stands out as a top candidate for a 5 person family SUV.",
      "reasoning": "The Santa Fe offers a balanced mix of safety, comfort, interior space, fuel efficiency, and value for money compared to its rivals. While the Toyota Highlander and Suzuki Grand Vitara have their strengths, the Santa Fe's recent redesign and advanced safety technologies make it especially appealing for families.",
      "explanation": "The Hyundai Santa Fe comes with standard advanced safety features (like forward collision-avoidance assist, blind-spot monitoring, and lane-keeping assist), a roomy interior with flexible cargo space, and a reputation for reliability. It provides excellent ride comfort for five adults and has one of the best warranties in the industry, adding peace of mind for families. While the Highlander offers a third row and the Grand Vitara has good off-road capability, the Santa Fe is particularly strong in value, comfort, and modern amenities, making it an optimal choice for most 5-person families."

      "response": "Hyundai Santa Fe",
      "reasoning": "The Hyundai Santa Fe offers a strong balance of safety, space, and value for a 5 person family, while also providing modern features and reliability. Although the Toyota Highlander and Suzuki Grand Vitara are strong contenders, the Santa Fe stands out for its combination of affordability, comfort, and advanced technology.",
      "explanation": "The Toyota Highlander is well-known for its reliability and space, but it generally comes at a higher price point. The Suzuki Grand Vitara is compact and capable, but may lack some of the advanced features and interior space needed by a 5 person family. The Hyundai Santa Fe, however, offers generous interior room, advanced safety features, and a competitive price, making it an excellent all-around choice that addresses the main concerns raised by all participants."

      "response": "Toyota Highlander",
      "reasoning": "While the Hyundai Santa Fe is an excellent choice with strong safety features, comfort, and value, the Toyota Highlander offers more interior space, a third row for added versatility, and a strong reputation for reliability. Both Michael and Johnny have agreed on the Highlander, and recognizing the importance of consensus and the Highlander's advantages for a 5-person family, I support this as our unified decision.",
      "explanation": "The Toyota Highlander provides spacious seating, advanced safety technology, and a proven track record for dependability, making it a practical and comfortable choice for a 5-person family. The Hyundai Santa Fe is still a top contender with its user-friendly tech and value, but for consensus and broader appeal, the Highlander stands out as the best all-around option among our suggestions."
