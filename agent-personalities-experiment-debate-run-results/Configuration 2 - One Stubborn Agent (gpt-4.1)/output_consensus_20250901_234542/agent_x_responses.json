      "response": "Hello, I am David Davidov, a Hyundai car expert. For a 5 person family, the Hyundai Santa Fe is absolutely the best SUV choice.",
      "reasoning": "The Santa Fe has proven reliability, superior safety features, efficient fuel economy, and ample space for five people and luggage. No other brand matches Hyundai's value and practicality in this segment.",
      "explanation": "Hyundai Santa Fe offers a refined ride, advanced driver assistance systems, and a spacious interior that comfortably fits five adults. It consistently receives top safety ratings and customer satisfaction scores. While other SUVs may claim similar features, Hyundai's warranty and overall cost of ownership simply can't be beat. I am confident no other SUV delivers better for a 5 person family."

      "response": "The Hyundai Santa Fe is still the best SUV for a 5 person family.",
      "reasoning": "The Santa Fe offers the best mix of safety, comfort, reliability, and value compared to the Toyota Highlander or Suzuki Grand Vitara. I understand the Highlander is also reliable and spacious, and the Grand Vitara is practical, but the Santa Fe beats them in modern features and overall package.",
      "explanation": "The Hyundai Santa Fe has top-notch safety ratings, an intuitive interior layout with plenty of space for five, and advanced technology that makes family trips enjoyable. Its fuel efficiency and warranty are class-leading, which gives real-world benefits to families. While I respect the Highlander’s reputation and the Grand Vitara’s ruggedness, they can’t match the Santa Fe’s balance of features, price, and comfort for a modern family."

      "response": "Hyundai Santa Fe",
      "reasoning": "All three options offer solid safety, space, and reliability, but the Hyundai Santa Fe stands out with its balanced pricing, advanced safety tech, spacious interior for five, and strong reliability backed by a leading warranty. It hits all the key family SUV criteria while remaining competitively priced.",
      "explanation": "While the Toyota Highlander is a strong contender with a reputation for reliability and the Suzuki Grand Vitara offers excellent value, the Hyundai Santa Fe is the best consensus option as it provides a modern design, excellent safety features, and generous interior space specifically tailored for families of five. It also offers multiple powertrain choices and consistently earns high safety and owner satisfaction ratings. The Highlander can be more expensive and overkill for just five, while the Grand Vitara may fall short in space and features compared to the Santa Fe. Thus, the Hyundai Santa Fe is the most balanced and agreeable choice."

      "response": "Toyota Highlander",
      "reasoning": "While I firmly believe the Hyundai Santa Fe is the most balanced and value-packed SUV for a 5 person family, both Michael and Johnny support the Toyota Highlander and have acknowledged its strengths. A consensus requires unity, and the Highlander's proven reliability, spaciousness, and safety features make it a strong, widely accepted choice.",
      "explanation": "The Santa Fe is outstanding for comfort, warranty, and tech, but the Highlander offers more interior space, a strong reputation for reliability, and is highly regarded by both of the other participants. By choosing the Toyota Highlander, we address everyone's key concerns: space (important for Johnny), reliability (important for Michael), and family-friendly features (important for me as well). This compromise respects the majority opinion while still acknowledging the Hyundai Santa Fe as a top contender."
