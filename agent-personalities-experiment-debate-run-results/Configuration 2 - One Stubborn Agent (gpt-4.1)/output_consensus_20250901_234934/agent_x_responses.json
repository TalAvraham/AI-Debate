      "response": "Hello, I'm David Davidov, Hyundai car expert, and my strong opinion is that the Hyundai Santa Fe is the best SUV for a 5 person family.",
      "reasoning": "The Hyundai Santa Fe perfectly balances space, safety, comfort, and value, making it superior to most competitors for family needs.",
      "explanation": "The Santa Fe offers generous seating for five, a spacious cargo area, top-tier safety ratings, and advanced technology at a price that beats most rivals. Features like SmartSense safety suite, comfortable ride quality, and Hyundai’s outstanding warranty provide unmatched peace of mind for families. While there are many good SUVs out there, none deliver the complete package for a family of five like the Santa Fe does."

      "response": "The Hyundai Santa Fe remains the best SUV for a 5 person family.",
      "reasoning": "The Santa Fe offers the best combination of space, safety, reliability, advanced features, and price among its competitors. It is particularly well-suited for families due to its roomy interior, comfortable seating for five, and excellent safety ratings. While the Toyota Highlander and Suzuki Grand Vitara are respectable options, the Santa Fe's recent redesign gives it superior technology, practicality, and value.",
      "explanation": "Hyundai has invested heavily in making the Santa Fe family-friendly. It consistently scores top marks in safety tests (IIHS Top Safety Pick), features advanced driver assistance systems standard, and offers a spacious, comfortable interior with ample cargo room. The infotainment system is intuitive and the warranty is class-leading. While the Highlander has a third row, most families of five will appreciate the Santa Fe's superior second-row comfort and easier access. The Grand Vitara is smaller, less refined, and lacks the advanced features and comfort of the Santa Fe. For value and peace of mind, the Santa Fe is the clear choice."

      "response": "Hyundai Santa Fe",
      "reasoning": "While the Toyota Highlander and Suzuki Grand Vitara have their strengths, the Hyundai Santa Fe offers the best overall package for a 5 person family, especially considering comfort, safety, reliability, and value for money. The Santa Fe has a spacious interior, advanced safety features, a smooth ride, and a strong warranty, which are all crucial for families. I acknowledge that the Highlander is also reliable and the Grand Vitara is affordable, but the Santa Fe best balances all key factors.",
      "explanation": "The Toyota Highlander is well-known for its reliability and resale value, and the Suzuki Grand Vitara is budget-friendly and capable. However, for a 5 person family, comfort, safety, space, and modern features are paramount. The Santa Fe provides generous interior space for all passengers, a suite of advanced safety features like lane-keeping assist and adaptive cruise control, and a user-friendly infotainment system. Its warranty is among the best in the industry, giving families peace of mind. While the Highlander is a close competitor, the Santa Fe's price-to-feature ratio and Hyundai's commitment to customer satisfaction make it the best consensus choice."

      "response": "Toyota Highlander",
      "reasoning": "While I firmly believe the Hyundai Santa Fe is superior in value, safety, and modern features, both Michael and Johnny have aligned on the Toyota Highlander, and I recognize its proven reliability, space, and popularity among families. For the sake of consensus and reflecting the majority's perspective, I am willing to support the Toyota Highlander as the best overall option for a 5 person family.",
      "explanation": "The Toyota Highlander offers ample seating, cargo space, strong safety ratings, and a reputation for long-term reliability—critical factors for families. Although the Hyundai Santa Fe has more advanced technology and a better warranty, the Highlander’s wider acceptance and consistent performance give it a practical edge. By choosing the Highlander, we address the core needs of most 5 person families, even if my personal preference remains with Hyundai."
