      "response": "Hello, I’m David Davidov, Hyundai car expert, and for a 5 person family, the best SUV is absolutely the Hyundai Santa Fe.",
      "reasoning": "The Hyundai Santa Fe offers the best balance of space, comfort, reliability, safety, and value for money compared to any competitor. No other brand consistently delivers the same level of features and peace of mind for families.",
      "explanation": "The Santa Fe provides ample room for five adults, excellent crash test ratings, advanced driver assistance features, and a long warranty. It’s more affordable than many rivals, yet still offers a premium interior and strong fuel economy. I’m very confident that for a 5 person family, nothing beats the Santa Fe."

      "response": "The Hyundai Santa Fe remains the best SUV for a 5 person family.",
      "reasoning": "The Santa Fe offers superior comfort, advanced safety features, strong reliability, and excellent value for money compared to the Toyota Highlander and Suzuki Grand Vitara. While the Highlander is a good car, it's often more expensive with features Hyundai offers as standard. The Grand Vitara falls short in space, tech, and refinement.",
      "explanation": "For a 5 person family, space and comfort are crucial, and the Santa Fe’s roomy interior ensures everyone has enough space, especially in the second row. It consistently receives high safety ratings, with Hyundai’s SmartSense suite coming standard. The Santa Fe’s pricing is more accessible, and its warranty is among the best. While Toyota and Suzuki are reputable, the Santa Fe strikes the best balance between price, features, and reliability, making it the most logical choice for families."

      "response": "The Hyundai Santa Fe is the best SUV for a 5 person family.",
      "reasoning": "While I respect that the Toyota Highlander and Suzuki Grand Vitara offer their own advantages, the Hyundai Santa Fe provides the best blend of comfort, safety, value, and practicality for a 5 person family. It has ample space, advanced safety features, and a competitive price point, making it the most balanced choice.",
      "explanation": "The Toyota Highlander does have a strong reputation for reliability and offers a third row, but for a typical 5 person family, the Santa Fe's two-row configuration offers more comfort and cargo space without sacrificing practicality. The Suzuki Grand Vitara is compact and capable off-road, but it lacks the modern features, space, and refinement that families need for daily use. The Hyundai Santa Fe stands out with its generous standard equipment, user-friendly infotainment, competitive pricing, and strong safety scores. It strikes the right balance between size, features, and value—making it the best consensus choice for a 5 person family."

    {
      "response": "Hyundai Santa Fe",
      "reasoning": "The Hyundai Santa Fe is the best compromise for a 5 person family because it offers excellent value, top-notch safety features, and a spacious, comfortable interior. While the Toyota Highlander and Suzuki Grand Vitara have their strengths, the Santa Fe balances affordability, reliability, and practicality, making it the most well-rounded choice.",
      "explanation": "The Toyota Highlander is a strong competitor known for its reliability and resale value, and the Suzuki Grand Vitara offers ruggedness and compactness. However, the Hyundai Santa Fe stands out with its advanced driver assistance systems, user-friendly technology, and roomy second-row seating—critical for family comfort. It also tends to come at a lower price point than the Highlander, providing better value for money without compromising on key family needs. By choosing the Santa Fe, we address concerns about safety, space, affordability, and overall family usability, making it the best consensus choice."

      "response": "Toyota Highlander",
      "reasoning": "Although I firmly believe the Hyundai Santa Fe is the superior choice due to its value, safety, and technology, I recognize that both Michael and Johnny have agreed on the Toyota Highlander. Reaching consensus is important, and the Highlander is a reliable, spacious, and practical SUV for a 5 person family. By agreeing, we satisfy the majority and ensure a unified recommendation.",
      "explanation": "The Toyota Highlander offers ample space, excellent reliability, and strong resale value. While I would have preferred the Hyundai Santa Fe for its comfort, affordability, and advanced features, consensus means aligning with the group. The Highlander is a solid, widely respected choice that will meet the needs of most families, even if I personally believe the Santa Fe is underrated."
