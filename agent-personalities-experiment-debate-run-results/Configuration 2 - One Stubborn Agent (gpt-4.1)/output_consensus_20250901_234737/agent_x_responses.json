      "response": "Hello, I’m David Davidov, Hyundai car expert. For a 5 person family, the Hyundai Santa Fe is absolutely the best SUV.",
      "reasoning": "The Santa Fe is known for its reliability, safety, spacious interior, and excellent value. Hyundai’s technology and warranty are unmatched in this segment.",
      "explanation": "The Santa Fe offers roomy seating for five, top safety scores, impressive fuel economy for its class, and a user-friendly infotainment system. It also comes with Hyundai’s industry-leading 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty, making it the most logical and worry-free choice for families. Other SUVs might have some nice features, but none put it all together as well as the Santa Fe."

      "response": "The Hyundai Santa Fe is the best SUV for a 5 person family.",
      "reasoning": "The Santa Fe offers exceptional value, safety, comfort, and advanced features that surpass the competition, especially when considering what matters most to families: space, reliability, and affordability. While the Toyota Highlander and Suzuki Grand Vitara are fine vehicles, they simply do not offer the same combination of modern technology, warranty, and overall balance as the Santa Fe.",
      "explanation": "Hyundai Santa Fe provides spacious seating for five, one of the best warranties in the business (10 years/100,000 miles), and a suite of safety features like SmartSense. Its interior is modern and family-friendly, with ample cargo space. In addition, Hyundai’s reputation for reliability and value has only grown, making the Santa Fe the smart, stubbornly logical choice. I acknowledge Toyota's reputation for reliability and Suzuki's affordability, but neither match the Santa Fe's comprehensive package for families."

      "response": "Hyundai Santa Fe",
      "reasoning": "After considering the Toyota Highlander and Suzuki Grand Vitara, I maintain that the Hyundai Santa Fe is the best consensus option for a 5-person family due to its superior balance of comfort, safety, value, and modern features. While the Highlander is reliable and the Grand Vitara is practical, the Santa Fe stands out with its advanced safety tech, spacious interior, and competitive pricing.",
      "explanation": "The Hyundai Santa Fe provides ample room for five passengers, top safety ratings, and a smooth, comfortable ride that suits families. Its interior offers more refinement and technology than the Suzuki Grand Vitara, and it is more affordable and efficient than the Toyota Highlander while still offering similar reliability. While I respect the merits of the Highlander and Grand Vitara, the Santa Fe is the most well-rounded choice for families seeking value, safety, and comfort."

    {
      "response": "Toyota Highlander",
      "reasoning": "While I firmly believe the Hyundai Santa Fe is the best for a 5-person family due to its value, safety, and technology, both Michael and Johnny have aligned on the Toyota Highlander. To reach a consensus, I recognize the Highlander's strong reputation, reliability, and spaciousness, which are also important for families.",
      "explanation": "My preference is for the Hyundai Santa Fe, which offers excellent comfort, safety features, and great value for money. However, consensus requires compromise. The Toyota Highlander is praised for its reliability, advanced safety systems, and ample space, which are critical for a family SUV. While the Suzuki Grand Vitara is a capable vehicle, it doesn't match the overall family-focused features of the Highlander or Santa Fe. Therefore, in the interest of consensus, the Toyota Highlander is selected as the best SUV for a 5-person family, with the Hyundai Santa Fe as a very close second."
