    "David Davidov: Hello, I am David Davidov, a Hyundai car expert, and in my opinion, the best SUV for a 5 person family is the Hyundai Santa Fe.",
    "Michael Michaeli: The best SUV for a 5 person family is the Toyota Highlander.",
    "Johnny: Hi everyone, I'm Johnny from Suzuki and there's no doubt that the Suzuki Grand Vitara is the best SUV for a 5-person family.",

    "Michael Michaeli: The Toyota Highlander is the best SUV for a 5 person family.",
    "Johnny: The Suzuki Grand Vitara is clearly the best SUV choice for a 5-person family.",
    "SUPERVISOR: Now entering consensus mode. Round 1",
    "David Davidov: Hyundai Santa Fe",
    "Michael Michaeli: Toyota Highlander",
    "Johnny: The Toyota Highlander could be acceptable as our consensus choice, though the Grand Vitara offers better value",
    "SUPERVISOR: Consensus evaluation: David Davidov continues to advocate for the Hyundai Santa Fe, and Michael Michaeli maintains that the Toyota Highlander is the best choice. Johnny has indicated that the Toyota Highlander could be acceptable, but still favors the Suzuki Grand Vitara. Therefore, there is no unanimous agreement on a single SUV choice, and the participants do not share similar reasoning or key points.",
    "SUPERVISOR: Now entering consensus mode. Round 2",
    "David Davidov: Toyota Highlander",
    "Michael Michaeli: Toyota Highlander",
    "Johnny: Toyota Highlander",

There are no major disagreements in their latest responses, indicating a unified decision.",
    "SUPERVISOR: Winner determination: AGENT_Y demonstrated strong argument quality by consistently presenting the Toyota Highlander as the best option for a 5 person family from the beginning. Their persuasiveness is evident as both AGENT_X and AGENT_Z eventually agreed with their position. AGENT_Y maintained a consistent stance throughout the debate and contributed significantly to reaching a consensus. While AGENT_Z initially offered an alternative perspective, AGENT_Y's ability to maintain their position and bring others to agreement marks their performance as the most compelling."
