      "response": "Hello, I am David Davidov, a Hyundai car expert, and in my opinion, the best SUV for a 5 person family is the Hyundai Santa Fe.",
      "reasoning": "The Hyundai Santa Fe is spacious, reliable, packed with safety features, and offers one of the best value propositions in its class. Its interior comfort, advanced technology, and strong warranty make it ideal for families.",
      "explanation": "With its roomy seating for five, generous cargo space, and top safety ratings, the Santa Fe stands out among midsize SUVs. The latest model comes with advanced driver-assistance systems, a user-friendly infotainment system, and excellent fuel efficiency for its size. Hyundai's industry-leading warranty gives peace of mind, and the Santa Fe is consistently rated highly by both owners and automotive experts."

      "response": "The Hyundai Santa Fe remains the best option for a 5 person family.",
      "reasoning": "The Santa Fe offers superior value, safety, and comfort compared to the Toyota Highlander and Suzuki Grand Vitara. While the Highlander is a solid vehicle, it's often more expensive for similar features. The Grand Vitara simply cannot match the space, technology, or refinement of the Santa Fe.",
      "explanation": "The Hyundai Santa Fe is specifically designed with families in mind. It offers ample legroom for all passengers, a spacious cargo area, top safety ratings, and a suite of advanced driver assistance features like SmartSense. The latest models provide impressive fuel efficiency, high reliability, and a best-in-class warranty. While I respect the reputation of Toyota and the Grand Vitara's affordability, the Santa Fe provides the best balance of comfort, price, practicality, and peace of mind for a 5 person family."

      "response": "Hyundai Santa Fe",
      "reasoning": "While the Toyota Highlander and Suzuki Grand Vitara have their merits, the Hyundai Santa Fe offers the best balance of space, comfort, safety features, and value for a 5 person family. It provides superior interior quality compared to the Grand Vitara and is more affordable and efficient than the Highlander, while still offering advanced technology and a strong warranty.",
      "explanation": "The Hyundai Santa Fe is spacious enough for a family of five, with ample cargo space and comfortable seating. Its safety ratings are top-tier, and it comes equipped with advanced driver assistance systems that families prioritize. While the Toyota Highlander is also a strong contender due to its reliability and third-row option, it is more expensive and less fuel-efficient than the Santa Fe. The Suzuki Grand Vitara, though rugged and compact, lacks the refinement, space, and modern features that today's families expect. Therefore, the consensus pick, considering all perspectives and family needs, is the Hyundai Santa Fe."

      "response": "Toyota Highlander",
      "reasoning": "While I firmly believe the Hyundai Santa Fe is the ideal SUV for a 5 person family due to its reliability, value, and comfort, I recognize that both Michael and Johnny accept the Toyota Highlander as a strong contender, with Johnny willing to compromise. In the interest of consensus, the Highlander addresses space, features, reliability, and resale value for families.",
      "explanation": "The Toyota Highlander offers a spacious interior, advanced safety features, strong resale value, and excellent reliability, which are all critical for a 5-person family. Although I remain convinced that the Hyundai Santa Fe provides better value and technology, agreeing on the Highlander ensures that all participants' key concerns are addressed, and consensus is reached."
