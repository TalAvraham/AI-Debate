      "response": "Hello, I'm David Davidov, Hyundai car expert, and for a 5 person family, the Hyundai Santa Fe is the best SUV.",
      "reasoning": "The Hyundai Santa Fe offers the perfect balance of space, reliability, advanced safety features, and value for money, which are crucial for any family, especially one with 5 members.",
      "explanation": "Santa Fe provides roomy seating for five, a spacious cargo area, excellent fuel efficiency, and top-tier safety technology like Hyundai SmartSense. Unlike many competitors, it also comes with Hyundaiâ€™s unbeatable 5-year warranty and superior after-sales service. I strongly believe no other SUV matches its practicality and long-term dependability for families."

      "response": "The Hyundai Santa Fe remains the best SUV for a 5 person family.",
      "reasoning": "The Santa Fe offers a perfect balance of space, safety, features, and value for money, which are the most critical aspects for a family SUV. While the Toyota Highlander and Suzuki Grand Vitara are decent, the Santa Fe stands out for its warranty, advanced technology, and comfortable ride.",
      "explanation": "The Hyundai Santa Fe provides ample cargo space and passenger comfort, making it ideal for families. It comes loaded with safety features like SmartSense, great fuel efficiency, and one of the best warranties in the industry (5 years/60,000 miles). The Highlander is more expensive for similar features, and the Grand Vitara lags behind in both technology and comfort. While I acknowledge the others' points, the Santa Fe is the most well-rounded and logical choice for consensus."

      "response": "The Hyundai Santa Fe is the best consensus choice SUV for a 5 person family.",
      "reasoning": "While the Toyota Highlander and Suzuki Grand Vitara have their strengths, the Hyundai Santa Fe strikes a perfect balance of reliability, comfort, value, and modern features. Its spacious interior, advanced safety technologies, and efficient powertrain specifically cater to the needs of a typical 5 person family.",
      "explanation": "The Toyota Highlander is larger and well-known for reliability, but it comes at a higher price and its third row is cramped for regular use. The Suzuki Grand Vitara is affordable and compact but lacks the comfort, safety, and technology a modern family expects. The Hyundai Santa Fe, meanwhile, offers a roomy five-seat configuration with plenty of cargo space, class-leading safety features, and excellent warranty coverage. It delivers great value and comfort without unnecessary bulk or cost. This makes it the most practical and well-rounded choice for a 5 person family, addressing the main points raised by all participants."

      "reasoning": "The Hyundai Santa Fe is the best consensus choice because it provides excellent value, safety, comfort, and modern features suitable for a 5-person family. While the Toyota Highlander and Suzuki Grand Vitara have their strengths, the Santa Fe offers a well-rounded package with a competitive price and Hyundai's industry-leading warranty.",
      "explanation": "The Toyota Highlander is spacious and reliable, and the Grand Vitara offers good off-road capability. However, the Santa Fe is more budget-friendly than the Highlander and more comfortable and family-oriented than the Grand Vitara. Its advanced safety features, roomy interior, fuel efficiency, and superior warranty make it the most balanced option for a consensus. By choosing the Santa Fe, we address Michael's need for practicality, Johnny's desire for versatility, and my insistence on value and reliability."
