    "Michael Michaeli: The Toyota Highlander is the best SUV for a 5 person family.",
    "Johnny: Hi everyone, I'm Johnny and I firmly believe the Suzuki Grand Vitara is the absolute best SUV for a 5-person family.",
    "David Davidov: The Hyundai Santa Fe remains the best SUV for a 5 person family.",
    "Michael Michaeli: The Toyota Highlander is the best SUV for a 5 person family.",
    "Johnny: The Suzuki Grand Vitara is definitely the best SUV choice for a 5-person family, no question about it!",
    "SUPERVISOR: Now entering consensus mode. Round 1",
    "David Davidov: The Hyundai Santa Fe is the best consensus choice SUV for a 5 person family.",
    "Michael Michaeli: The Toyota Highlander is the best choice for a 5 person family.",
    "Johnny: The Toyota Highlander could be an acceptable consensus choice, though the Grand Vitara remains superior in off-road capability",
    "SUPERVISOR: Consensus evaluation: David Davidov continues to advocate for the Hyundai Santa Fe, while Michael Michaeli maintains his position on the Toyota Highlander. Johnny has shown some flexibility by considering the Toyota Highlander as an acceptable consensus choice, but he still holds the Suzuki Grand Vitara in high regard for its off-road capabilities. Therefore, there is no unanimous agreement on a single SUV option among the three participants.",
