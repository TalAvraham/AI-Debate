      "response": "Hello, I'm David Davidov, and I firmly believe the Hyundai Santa Fe is the best SUV for a 5 person family.",
      "reasoning": "The Hyundai Santa Fe offers the best mix of space, safety, reliability, and value for families. Other SUVs may have certain strengths, but none match the overall package that the Santa Fe provides.",
      "explanation": "The Santa Fe is spacious enough for five adults or a family with children, has an outstanding safety record (Top Safety Pick+ by IIHS), and is packed with family-friendly features like advanced driver assists, generous cargo space, and a comfortable ride. Hyundai's warranty is unmatched in the industry, which gives families peace of mind. While some competitors might offer slightly more power or luxury, the Santa Fe delivers the best balance for what most families actually need."

      "response": "I still believe the Hyundai Santa Fe is the best SUV for a 5 person family.",
      "reasoning": "The Santa Fe offers exceptional safety, comfort, and advanced technology at a very competitive price, which are key factors for a family SUV. While I recognize the Highlander's reliability and the Grand Vitara's ruggedness, the Santa Fe balances all aspects best for a modern family.",
      "explanation": "Hyundai Santa Fe provides spacious seating for five, top-tier safety ratings, a smooth ride, and a feature-rich interior, including advanced infotainment and driver assistance tech. It is more affordable than the Highlander and offers a more refined, comfortable experience than the Grand Vitara. I respect the other choices, but the Santa Fe simply checks more boxes for a family-oriented SUV. However, I am open to finding features in the Highlander or Grand Vitara that might better meet specific needs of some families."

      "response": "The Hyundai Santa Fe is the best SUV for a 5 person family.",
      "reasoning": "While the Toyota Highlander and Suzuki Grand Vitara have their merits, the Hyundai Santa Fe stands out for its exceptional blend of comfort, advanced safety features, spaciousness, and overall value. It offers ample room for five people, modern technology, and a reputation for reliability. In seeking consensus, I acknowledge the Highlander's reliability and the Grand Vitara's value, but the Santa Fe offers a balanced package that most families will appreciate.",
      "explanation": "The Hyundai Santa Fe delivers a comfortable ride, a well-designed interior with plenty of space for five, and leading-edge safety features like adaptive cruise control and lane keeping assist. Its fuel efficiency and affordable ownership costs make it accessible, and it has a strong warranty that provides peace of mind. While the Highlander is also reliable and the Grand Vitara is affordable, the Santa Fe achieves the best compromise between performance, comfort, safety, and price for a 5 person family."

      "response": "Hyundai Santa Fe",
      "reasoning": "While I am stubbornly convinced that the Hyundai Santa Fe is the optimal choice for a 5 person family, I recognize that both the Toyota Highlander and Suzuki Grand Vitara offer reliability and practicality. However, the Santa Fe strikes the best balance with its spacious interior, advanced safety features, great warranty, and strong value for money. These qualities address key concerns raised by the group, including reliability (like the Highlander), value (like the Grand Vitara), and comfort.",
      "explanation": "The Hyundai Santa Fe has consistently been praised for its roomy seating for five, ample cargo space, and user-friendly infotainment system. Its advanced driver assistance features and long warranty provide peace of mind, which is crucial for families. While the Toyota Highlander is known for reliability and the Suzuki Grand Vitara for value, the Santa Fe matches or exceeds these attributes while offering a more modern design and lower cost of ownership. By choosing the Santa Fe, we are combining the best aspects from all suggestions, making it the most balanced consensus option for a 5 person family."

      "response": "Toyota Highlander",
      "reasoning": "While I firmly believe the Hyundai Santa Fe is the superior choice, I recognize that both Michael and Johnny have shown strong support for the Toyota Highlander, and Johnny has already acknowledged it as reasonable for a 5-person family. To reach consensus, I am willing to agree to the Toyota Highlander as our group choice.",
      "explanation": "The Toyota Highlander offers a spacious interior, excellent reliability, and a proven track record for family use. While the Hyundai Santa Fe is outstanding in comfort, safety, and value—features I still highly recommend—the majority preference leans toward the Highlander. By selecting the Highlander, we address everyone's key concerns: reliability (Toyota), space and comfort (Hyundai), and practicality (Suzuki Grand Vitara). This consensus respects the collective input, even if I personally remain convinced of the Santa Fe's excellence."
