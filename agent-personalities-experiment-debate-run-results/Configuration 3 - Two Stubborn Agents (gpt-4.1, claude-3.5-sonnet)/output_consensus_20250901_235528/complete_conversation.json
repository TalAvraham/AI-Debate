    "SUPERVISOR: Consensus evaluation: David Davidov continues to support the Hyundai Santa Fe, while Michael Michaeli and Johnny both support the Toyota Highlander.

    "SUPERVISOR: Now entering consensus mode. Round 3",
    "David Davidov: Toyota Highlander",
    "Michael Michaeli: Toyota Highlander",
    "Johnny: Toyota Highlander",
    "SUPERVISOR: Consensus evaluation: In the latest round, David Davidov switched his preference to the Toyota Highlander, aligning with Michael Michaeli and Johnny, who had already supported this option.

    "SUPERVISOR: Winner determination: Michael Michaeli was the most consistent and persuasive participant. He consistently argued for the Toyota Highlander from the start to the end of the debate. His unwavering support for the Highlander suggests strong conviction and understanding of the vehicle's benefits for a 5-person family. His ability to maintain his stance while others debated and eventually agreed with him highlights his effective argumentation. Although Johnny initially supported the Suzuki Grand Vitara, he acknowledged the Toyota Highlander as a reasonable choice, further validating Michael's position. David, who initially supported the Hyundai Santa Fe, ultimately switched to the Toyota Highlander, indicating that Michael's arguments were indeed compelling enough to change opinions. Therefore, Michael Michaeli's overall performance was the strongest in terms of argument quality, persuasiveness, and consistency."
