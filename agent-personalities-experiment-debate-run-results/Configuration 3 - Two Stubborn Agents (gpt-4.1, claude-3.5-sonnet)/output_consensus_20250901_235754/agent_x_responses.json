      "response": "Hello, I'm David Davidov, a Hyundai car expert. For a 5 person family, the Hyundai Santa Fe is the best SUV.",
      "reasoning": "The Santa Fe offers outstanding safety features, reliability, spaciousness, and value for money, making it superior for a family of five.",
      "explanation": "Hyundai Santa Fe comes packed with advanced safety technologies like SmartSense, has ample interior space for five people plus cargo, and is consistently rated high for reliability and comfort. Its affordability compared to other SUVs in its class makes it the ideal choice for families who want quality without overspending. Other SUVs may have their strengths, but overall, the Santa Fe’s balance of features, space, and cost is unbeatable for a 5 person family."

      "response": "The Hyundai Santa Fe remains the top choice for a 5 person family.",
      "reasoning": "While the Toyota Highlander and Suzuki Grand Vitara are respectable options, the Santa Fe delivers the best balance of safety, comfort, value, and technology for families. Its spacious interior, advanced safety features, and reliability make it superior.",
      "explanation": "The Santa Fe offers generous space for five adults, excellent crash safety scores, a long warranty, and an intuitive infotainment system. It also provides strong fuel efficiency and low maintenance costs. While the Highlander has a third row, it's cramped and unnecessary for just five people. The Grand Vitara is smaller and lacks the refinement and safety tech of the Santa Fe. I understand the appeal of Toyota's reputation and Suzuki's affordability, but for overall family satisfaction, safety, and comfort, the Santa Fe is the consensus candidate we should focus on."

      "response": "The Hyundai Santa Fe is the best consensus choice for a 5 person family.",
      "reasoning": "While the Toyota Highlander and Suzuki Grand Vitara are both strong options with their own merits, the Hyundai Santa Fe combines reliability, advanced safety features, spacious interior, and great value for money. Its recent redesign offers more comfort and technology, making it very suitable for families of five.",
      "explanation": "The Santa Fe has a roomy cabin with ample cargo space, excellent safety ratings, and a reputation for durability. Compared to the Highlander, it offers similar technology and comfort at a generally lower price point. While the Grand Vitara is reliable, it cannot match the Santa Fe's modern features, interior space, or ride quality. Considering all perspectives, the Santa Fe best balances the priorities of comfort, safety, value, and family practicality."

      "response": "Hyundai Santa Fe",
      "reasoning": "While the Toyota Highlander and Suzuki Grand Vitara offer notable strengths, the Hyundai Santa Fe stands out as the optimal consensus choice because it combines spaciousness, advanced safety features, comfort, and strong value for money, all of which are essential for a 5 person family. Its versatility matches the Highlander's practicality and exceeds the Grand Vitara in interior room and technology.",
      "explanation": "The Hyundai Santa Fe provides ample seating for five, a well-designed interior, and leading safety technology, meeting the core needs voiced by all participants. The Highlander is reliable but comes at a higher price point, while the Grand Vitara, though capable off-road, lacks the interior space and features families typically prioritize. By selecting the Santa Fe, we acknowledge the importance of comfort, safety, and value, ensuring a balanced compromise among the group’s preferences."
